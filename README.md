# **Greeklish-English Text Classifier**  

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that classifies text as **Greeklish or English** using **NLP and Deep Learning** techniques. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training (LSTM & Logistic Regression), and evaluation.  

## **Installation & Setup**  

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/greeklish-classifier.git
   cd greeklish-classifier
   ```  
   
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
   
3. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```  
   Then, open the **Greeklish_Classifier.ipynb** file and run all cells sequentially.

## **Project Workflow**  

✔ **Data Collection:** Web scraping and dataset compilation.  
✔ **Preprocessing:** Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization (TF-IDF & Embeddings).  
✔ **Model Training:** Logistic Regression & LSTM-based Neural Network.  
✔ **Evaluation:** Model accuracy, classification reports, and testing.  

## **Testing the Model**  

Once trained, you can input new text in the Jupyter Notebook and check predictions to classify it as **Greeklish or English**.
